                <p>The school has a fully equipped air-conditioned Medicare centre for first aid, and one school nurse is available on all working days between 7.30 am and 2.15 pm. A paediatrician visits the school daily. A routine medical check-up is conducted every year for the children and intimation is sent to the parents if remedial measures need to be taken. The checkup includes height, weight and eyesight. A yearly dental check-up is also conducted with regular follow-ups where necessary. In an emergency, the school has a tie-up with a fully equipped nursing home and hospital nearby.

                </p>

                <p>The Indian School’s endeavour for Inclusive Education is the Special Needs Department that delivers quality education, meeting basic learning needs and enriching lives. The department comprises of a special educator and the school psychologist, who cater to the needs of students suffering from needs like dyslexia, dyscalculia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder etc. The classes are held in a room on the first floor which is easily accessible to students. After an informal assessment by the special educator and the school counsellor, the child is referred to professionals registered under the RCI (Rehabilitation Council of India) - Dr Jitendra Nagpal at Moolchand Medcity and Dr Roma Kumar at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, to name a few.
<br><br>

                    The activities conducted by the SEN ( Special Education Needs) department are:

                    </ol>
                    <p>The children are given the freedom to explore their potential with the help of experts in areas of drama, music, arts etc. The main idea is to inculcate certain life skills so that the child feels more empowered to deal with the challenges of life and become successful.

<p>The school has CCTV cameras in every classroom, the labs, the playfield, all entry and exit points, corridors etc. This surveillance helps ensure a high level of security, particularly relevant in today’s scenario. The school is fully equipped with fire-fighting equipment. Monthly fire drills ensure that the school can be evacuated in three minutes. All staff members and students are trained by fire fighting officers and are taught regularly to manage fire extinguishers. Greater preparedness is being built in for other disasters such as earthquakes, terror attacks, virals like dengue, chikungunya etc.
 <br> <br>The campus is fumigated every day.

<br> <br>
Drinking water is tested every quarter. Servicing and cleaning of water coolers is done every week. The water purifiers are serviced every month.
Our school can boast of litter-free corridors and grounds, and odour-free toilets at all times of the day.
