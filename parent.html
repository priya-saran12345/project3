                <p>We share a very effective and amicable relationship with our parents.

                     <br> <br>
                     The enclosed photographs are, we hope, ample testimony to that! Parents are invited to regular orientations but the first one, as the 3 year- old year child enters school, is particularly sacred. At our Diya Ceremony, parents place diyas lit by the pre-primary teachers as symbolic of the precious partnership that the School steps into with the parents, to bring up together, our children for the next 14 years of their lives. Fourteen years later, when they are ready to graduate from School, the children carry back the same diyas to light up, as it were, the world outside.

<h3>DIYA CEREMONY WITH WHICH PARENTS ENTER INTO A PARTNERSHIP WITH THE SCHOOL

</h3>
<p>At the <b>Pre Primary and Primary levels</b> , parents help us with our “Star-of-the-Day –Day” programme by coming to class and sharing with the other children, the favourite anecdotes and stories of their child. In a happy response, the other classmates make drawings for their new friend which are then bound together and given as a souvenir to the child.
 <br> <br>
 At the other end of the spectrum, parents of classes X and XI help with  <b>Summer Placement internships</b>.


</p>
<img src="https://theindianschool.in/uploads/editor/17036672946405-parent-section.jpg" alt="">
<p>Parents particularly come to our aid with our special Evening Excursions by accompanying teachers and children to early evening programmes such as musical concerts, dance and theatre performances, book readings, and special talks by eminent speakers, thus helping us to fully enjoy our city as the marvellous cultural resource that it is. At Annual Days and Sports Days, our parents’ help is incalculable. Our School events have helped to foster a spirit of community and camaraderie among teachers, parents and students.
 <br>  <br>Apart from all this, there are regular parent-teacher meetings. Parents can also meet with class teachers and subject teachers by appointment.


</p>

<h3>GRANDPARENTS' DAY
</h3>
<p>Parents are invited to all regular School events and members of the families are also invited to special assemblies like
    <b> Grandma’s Day, Mother’s Day, Father’s Day, Uncle’s Day, and Pratah Stuti for all Grandparents on Gandhi Jayanti</b>.
     Regular communication between parents and School takes place through our beautifully designed School Almanac, which also carries the School’s calendar of activities for the year.
</p>
<img src="https://theindianschool.in/uploads/editor/17018481342541-annual-exhibhition.jpg" alt="">
<p>Daily and instant communication is now through electronic mode i.e. via our School website which reports on every activity in the school, accompanied by photographs.
 <br> <br>
 SMSs are promptly sent out in case of urgency. The electronic mode reduces the consumption of paper and thus reduces our carbon footprint. Parents fully cooperate with us in this endeavour at environmental preservation.

<br> <br>
There is a discussion forum for parents through our web portal and also a parent portal to access from anywhere the MyClassBoard software. Issues that need to be shared with the school are brought up at regular intervals. Summer Job Placements – we send students to do an  internship with different organisations varying from newspaper offices to manufacturing units to banks, etc.

<br> <br>
Finally the Principal, Vice Principal, Academic Coordinators, teachers, and staff are always available, by appointment, to discuss the progress or welfare of the children.
